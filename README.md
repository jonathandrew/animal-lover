INSTRUCTIONS:
Setup:
*create an app called animal-lover
*delete src and recreate index file &components folder with App.js file
*create Animals component in components folder and render it in the App.js file
*create an images folder inside the public folder
*choose 3 types of animals
*download 12 animal images 3 of each kind.
*name and place them in your images folder
Main:
*create an array of objects called animals and place inside Animals component
\*keys for each object should be named

1.  image
2.  type
3.  name
4.  description
5.  animalId
    *use the images in your images folder as a hard coded path for each image key in array
    *for each animal object, define the image path, give it a name, specify type of animal, and use lorem ipsum for a description (or make a real one if you wnat) and a use a unique string for each animalId
    *create one card that will be used to represent all of animals. Use the semanitc ui suggestion or design your own card
    *take a look at the screenshot the layout MUST be like this
    *on semantic website the code for a 'Single Card' is usable with editing. you will have to remove the friends section and add 3 buttons to it
    *your layout will include a main area and a right sidebar
    *on the main page you will have 12 cards shown based on one repeated card with different info in each
    *each card will have:
6.  image
7.  name of animal
8.  type of animal
9.  description and below that….
10. 3 buttons Like, Dislike, Discard (see screenshot)
    *the sidebar will have a list of Likes and Don't likes (see screenshot)
    *In the main area, when I click on Like button the image and name only will appear in the likes list of the sidebar
    *In the main area when I click on Dislike button the image and name only will appear in the Dislike list of the Sidebar
    *If I click on Discard button in the main window the animal disappears from BOTH the main area AND the sidebar
    *If I click on the Animal in the Like or Dislike Column it removes it is removed from that column
    *If the animal is in the Like list it cannot be in the Dislike list
    *If the Animal is already in one of the lists it cannot be placed on the list again.
    *This is not that hard code wise so make it look as nice as possible.
    Stretch Goals:
    *Add a search for the type of animal where I can just look at…say..dogs for example
    *Split into smaller components
    *Add Animal
    *If there are no animals in the likes or dislikes column, show a message saying No Likes or No Dislikes
    \*Add a counter of the likes and dislikes that increments and decrements
